compiling
fixed

multiplications
an
algorithm
is
developed
for
compiling
as
sequence
of
shifts
additions
and
subtractions
many
fixed
point
binary
multiplications
involving
constant
the
most
significant
characteristics
of
the
algorithm
are
the
simplicity
of
the
test
which
determines
if
the
algorithm
should
be
applied
and
the
degree
to
which
it
suggests
