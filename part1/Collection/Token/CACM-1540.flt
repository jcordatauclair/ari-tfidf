an
algorithm
for
class
scheduling
with
section
preference
an
algorithm
for
assignment
of
students
to
classes
in
fixed
time
schedule
that
allows
students
to
give
preference
for
sections
within
courses
is
given
if
consistent
with
the
objective
of
balanced
sections
these
preferences
will
be
honored
the
algorithm
is
more
stochastic
than
monte
carlo
in
nature
results
are
given
that
compare
it
to
nonpreference
