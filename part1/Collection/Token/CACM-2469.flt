petri
nets
and
speed
independent
design
petri
nets
are
investigated
as
one
method
of
modeling
speed
independent
asynchronous
circuits
study
of
circuit
realizations
of
petri
nets
leads
to
demonstration
of
their
usefulness
in
modeling
speed
independent
operation
this
usefulness
is
emphasized
by
the
design
of
speed
independent
processor
from
modules
developed
in
the
investigation
of
petri
net
implementation
