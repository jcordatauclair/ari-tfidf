method
for
finding
the
least
squares
estimate
of
the
intersection
point
of
two
helices
in
space
when
the
helical
trajectories
of
two
charged
particles
moving
away
from
common
point
in
magnetic
field
are
reconstructed
from
measurements
on
the
tracks
the
reconstructed
tracks
are
perturbed
by
measurement
and
other
errors
and
do
not
in
general
intersect
method
is
given
for
adjusting
the
reconstructed
tracks
in
least
squares
manner
so
that
they
do
intersect
