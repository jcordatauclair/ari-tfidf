further
evidence
for
the
analysis
of
algorithms
for
the
zero-one
programming
problem
the
purpose
of
this
note
is
to
report
computational
experience
additional
to
that
recently
summarized
by
gue
et
al
with
two
algorithms
for
the
zero-one
linear
programming
problem
an
error
in
gue
paper
is
corrected
the
utility
of
one
of
the
algorithms
as
suboptimizer
is
indicated
