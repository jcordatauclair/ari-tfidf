theory
of
discrete
patterns
and
their
implementation
in
snobol4
the
notion
of
discrete
pattern
is
formalized
and
certain
properties
deduced
pattern
is
shown
to
be
generalization
of
formal
language
algorithms
for
implementing
the
kinds
of
patterns
in
snobol4
are
given
the
general
approach
is
to
create
in-so-far
as
possible
