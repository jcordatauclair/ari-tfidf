find
first
informal
description
is
given
of
the
purpose
of
the
program
and
the
method
used
systematic
technique
is
described
for
constructing
the
program
proof
during
the
process
of
coding
it
in
such
way
as
to
prevent
the
intrusion
of
logical
errors
the
proof
of
termination
is
treated
as
separate
exercise
finally
some
conclusions
relating
to
general
programming
methodology
are
drawn
