class
of
iterative
techniques
for
the
factorization
of
polynomials*
method
of
iteration
is
developed
in
terms
of
function
of
somewhat
arbitrary
character
sufficient
conditions
are
given
for
convergence
of
the
process
yielding
factors
of
arbitrary
degree
for
polynomials
in
one
variable
both
lin
method
and
newton
method
occur
as
special
