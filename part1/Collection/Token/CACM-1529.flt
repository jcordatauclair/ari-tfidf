an
analysis
of
matrix
substructure
petroleum
blending
problem
was
analyzed
in
order
to
compare
the
primal
and
primal-dual
decomposition
algorithms
in
the
course
of
the
analysis
substructure
was
discovered
which
has
relevance
to
the
relative
performance
of
the
two
algorithms
and
to
their
absolute
performance
as
compared
with
standard
primal-simplex
solution
without
decomposition
