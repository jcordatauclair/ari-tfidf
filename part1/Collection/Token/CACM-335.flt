some
numerical
experiments
using
newton
method
for
nonlinear
parabolic
and
ellipticboundary-value
problems
using
generalization
of
newton
method
nonlinear
parabolic
equation
of
the
form
xx
and
nonlinear
elliptic
equation
xx
yy
are
solved
numerically
comparison
of
these
results
with
results
obtained
using
the
picard
iteration
procedure
show
that
in
many
cases
the
quisi
linearization
method
offers
substantial
advantages
in
both
time
and
accuracy
