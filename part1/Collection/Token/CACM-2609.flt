interpolation
with
rounded
ramp
functions
new
interpolation
function
is
introduced
it
has
infinitely
many
continuous
derivatives
and
is
composition
of
ramp
functions
with
smoothed
bends
called
rounded
ramp
functions
how
the
interpolation
function
can
be
extended
to
more
than
one
variable
is
shown
an
efficient
fortran
program
is
given
by
which
the
interpolation
function
can
be
obtained
for
given
point
set
