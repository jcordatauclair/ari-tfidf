of
linear
equations
an
algorithm
is
presented
for
solving
system
of
linear
equation
bu=k
where
is
tridiagonal
and
of
special
form
it
is
shown
that
this
algorithm
is
almost
twice
as
fast
as
the
gaussian
elimination
method
usually
suggested
for
solving
such
systems
in
addition
explicit
formulas
for
the
inverse
and
determinant
of
the
matrix
are
given
