of

technique
is
developed
which
allows
nearly
all
of
the
activity
needed
for
garbage
detection
and
collection
to
be
performed
by
an
additional
processor
operating
con-currently
with
the
processor

and
synchronization
constraints
have
been
kept
as
weak
as

be
achieved
the
severe
complexities
engendered
by
doing
