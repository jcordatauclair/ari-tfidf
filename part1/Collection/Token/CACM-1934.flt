on
arithmetic
expressions
and
trees
description
is
given
of
how
tree
representing
the
evaluation
of
an
arithmetic
expression
can
be
drawn
in
such
way
that
the
number
of
accumulators
needed
for
the
computation
can
be
represented
in
straightforward
manner
this
representation
reduces
the
choice
of
the
best
order
of
computation
to
specific
problem
under
the
theory
of
graphs
an
algorithm
to
solve
this
problem
is
presented
