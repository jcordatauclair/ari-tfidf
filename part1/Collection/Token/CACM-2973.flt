sorting
on
mesh-connected
parallel
computer
two
algorithms
are
presented
for
sorting
elements
on
an
mesh-connected
processor
array
that
require
routing
and
comparison
steps
the
best
previous
algorithm
takes
time
log
the
algorithms
of
this
paper
are
shown
to
be
optimal
in
time
within
small
constant
factors
extensions
to
higher-dimensional
arrays
are
