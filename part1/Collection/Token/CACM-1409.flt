oregon
state
university
has
designed
and
constructed
medium-speed
serial
digital
computer
using
glass
delay
lines
circulating
at
mc
as
memory
the
design
objectives
as
originally
conceived
in
special
seminar
were
to
be
research
project
in
computer
design
to
be
usable
as
an
educational
machine
and
to
have
easily
modifiable
hardware
for
basic
research
in
computer
systems
design
an
unusual
arrangement
of
information
within
the
mc
memory
allows
simple
interface
with
the
kc
arithmetic
unit
which
results
in
an
effective
zero
latency
time
and
provides
possibilities
for
an
associative
memory
the
arithmetic
unit
has
command
structure
similar
to
large
parallel
machines
and
uses
flip-flop
arithmetic
and
control
registers
throughout
all
hardware
development
has
been
aimed
toward
the
concept
of
easy
modification
elaborate
console
controls
for
effective
man-machine
interaction
and
low
cost
