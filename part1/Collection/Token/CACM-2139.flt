implementation
of
the
substring
test
by
hashing
technique
is
described
for
implementing
the
test
which
determines
if
one
string
is
substring
of
another
when
there
is
low
probability
that
the
test
will
be
satisfied
it
is
shown
how
the
operation
can
be
speeded
up
considerably
if
it
is
preceded
by
test
on
appropriately
chosen
hash
codes
of
the
strings
