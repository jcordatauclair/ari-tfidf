design
for
number
theory
package
with
an
optimized
trial
division
routine
number
theory
package
is
described
which
uses
doubly
linked
list
structures
for
storing
multiprecise
integers
the
package
has
been
coded
in
ibm
basic
assembly
language
and
makes
heavy
use
of
the
macro
language
and
conditional
assembly
an
optimally
coded
trial
division
routine
is
also
described
which
can
be
used
to
determine
the
unique
factorization
of
large
integers
