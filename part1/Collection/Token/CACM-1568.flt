plotting
function
of
three
independent
variables
method
is
developed
for
constructing
an
approximate
plot
of
function
of
three
independent
variables
the
plot
is
similar
to
conventional
contour
map
except
that
there
are
three
scales
to
represent
the
independent
variables
scale
values
of
the
three
independent
variables
are
added
vectorially
and
the
value
of
the
function
is
then
read
from
the
values
associated
with
nearby
contours
