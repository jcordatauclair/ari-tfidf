weighted
derivation
trees
the
nodes
of
weighted
derivation
tree
are
associated
with
weighting
functions
over
the
vocabulary
of
context-free
grammar
an
algorithm
is
presented
for
constructing
the
optimal
derivation
tree
having
the
same
structure
as
given
weighted
derivation
tree
in
addition
the
correctness
of
the
algorithm
is
established
the
method
may
be
applied
to
problems
involving
probabilistic
parsing
or
combinatorial
optimization
