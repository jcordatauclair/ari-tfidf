integer
and
signed
constants
in
algol
few
remarks
are
given
on
the
relations
between
syntax
and
semantics
in
the
programming
languages
the
aim
is
to
point
out
that
if
it
is
true
that
the
grammar
of
context-free
language
should
be
conceived
not
only
as
strings-generating
device
but
also
as
method
for
expressing
meaning
then
the
grammar
of
algol
is
open
to
some
criticism
