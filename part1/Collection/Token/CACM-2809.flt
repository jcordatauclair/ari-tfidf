positivity
and
norms
following
some
lines
of
joint
work
with
householder
the
character
and
use
of
algebraic
methods
in
the
theory
of
norms
is
demonstrated
new
results
concerning
norms
with
values
in
an
archimedian
vector
lattice
not
necessarily
being
totally
ordered
are
given
in
particular
for
the
generalization
of
order
unit
norms
and
an
example
of
application
to
operator
norms
is
given
concerning
contraction
properties
of
positive
operators
