study
of
storage
partitioning
using
mathematical
model
of
locality
both
fixed
and
dynamic
storage
partitioning
procedures
are
examined
for
use
in
multiprogramming
systems
the
storage
requirement
of
programs
is
modeled
as
stationary
gaussian
process
experiments
justifying
this
model
are
described
by
means
of
this
model
dynamic
storage
partitioning
is
shown
to
provide
substantial
increases
in
storage
utilization
and
operating
efficiency
over
fixed
partitioning
