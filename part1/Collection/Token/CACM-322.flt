committee
of
the
share
organization
has
devoted
considerable
effort
to
the
problem
of
operating
computer
efficiently
in
view
of
the
growing
number
of
programming
systems
available
each
of
these
programming
systems
has
been
coded
to
utilize
fixed
set
of
hardware
components
without
recognizing
the
fact
that
others
may
be
occupying
storage
medium
required
by
the
first
these
incompatibilities
are
currently
resolved
by
manually
setting
up
the
computer
for
each
system
as
required
the
following
set
of
conventions
is
being
considered
to
minimize
computer
set-up
time
they
are
of
sufficiently
broad
interest
that
we
feel
other
computer
users
should
be
aware
of
