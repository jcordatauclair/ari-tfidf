least-squares
analysis
of
resonance
spectra
on
small
computers
the
problem
of
analyzing
data
from
mossbauer
effect
experiment
is
discussed
by
using
the
cut
step
procedure
for
convergence
and
by
imposing
physical
constraints
on
the
functional
form
of
the
calculation
it
is
possible
to
make
the
analysis
on
small
computer
the
analysis
has
been
carried
out
on
an
ibm
computer
with
bcd
