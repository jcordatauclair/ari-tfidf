bits
are
not
enough
for
accuracy
from
the
inequality
we
are
likely
to
conclude
that
we
can
represent
decimal
floating-point
numbers
accurately
by
floating-point
numbers
however
we
need
significant
bits
to
represent
some
numbers
accurately
in
general
we
can
show
that
if
then
significant
bits
are
always
enough
for
decimal
accuracy
finally
we
can
define
compact
floating-point
representation
that
will
give
significant
bits
for
numbers
of
practical
importance
