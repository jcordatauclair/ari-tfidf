the
ease
of
programming
the
tabular
method
of
analysis
of
variance
for
complete
factorial
experiments
in
fortran
language
is
demonstrated
in
this
method
the
total
sum
of
squares
is
partitioned
into
orthogonal
single
degree
of
freedom
sums
of
squares
main
effect
and
interaction
sums
of
squares
are
then
obtained
by
appropriate
pooling
of
the
single
degree
of
freedom
sums
of
squares
program
segments
to
accomplish
the
procedure
are
presented
modifications
to
handle
hierarchical
designs
and
replicated
experiments
are
mentioned
fortran
ii
program
for
an
ibm
is
described
