software
design
and
evaluation
system
critical
failure
of
current
software
system
design
and
implementation
methodology
is
that
the
performance
of
proposed
design
is
not
evaluated
before
it
is
actually
implemented
in
this
paper
the
reasons
for
this
failure
are
explored
and
new
methodology
which
overcomes
many
of
the
difficulties
is
proposed
system
which
integrates
performance
evaluation
with
design
and
implementation
is
described
this
system
is
based
on
simple
high
level
language
which
is
used
to
describe
the
evolving
system
at
all
stages
of
its
development
the
source
language
description
is
used
as
direct
input
to
performance
analysis
and
simulation
routines
using
the
performance
information
obtained
from
these
routines
as
feedback
the
problems
which
adversely
affect
performance
are
detected
early
enough
so
that
they
can
be
corrected
without
costly
major
reimplementation
of
the
proposed
system
