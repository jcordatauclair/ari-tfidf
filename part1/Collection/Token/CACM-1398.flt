screening
solution
to
multivariate
type
problems
in
the
biological
and
social
sciences
new
approach
is
outlined
toward
the
solution
of
the
type
of
multivariate
problem
that
is
found
usually
in
the
biological
and
social
sciences
as
well
as
in
medicine
this
approach
uses
logical
rather
than
statistical
criterion
by
which
variables
are
grouped
into
deterministic
model
algorithm
are
developed
by
which
some
variables
are
kept
on
for
further
analysis
while
others
are
eliminated
criteria
for
the
acceptance
of
variable
as
well
as
the
termination
of
the
searching
process
are
derived
from
information
theory
