cubic
splines
on
uniform
meshes
very
simple
procedure
is
presented
for
constructing
cubic
splines
periodic
or
nonperiodic
on
uniform
meshes
arcs
of
two
cubics
suffice
to
construct
basis
of
cardinal
splines
an
algorithm
is
given
which
requires
only
minimal
storage
and
computation
and
permits
easy
trade-off
of
one
against
the
other
