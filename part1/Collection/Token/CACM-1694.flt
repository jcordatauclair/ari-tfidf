an
algorithm
for
the
probability
of
the
union
of
large
number
of
events
an
algorithm
is
presented
which
efficiently
evaluates
the
probability
for
the
union
of
independent
and
not
mutually
exclusive
events
the
problem
is
that
of
evaluating
the
sums
of
the
products
of
all
possible
combinations
of
variables
in
minimum
time
and
storage
space
