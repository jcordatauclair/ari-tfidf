and
the
application
of
algebraic
manipulative
systems
the
paper
describes
some
applications
of
symbolic
algebra
systems
to
problems
of
general
relativity
including
the
derivation
of
the
field
equations
the
petrov
classification
of
metric
and
the
solution
of
the
field
equations
in
the
presence
of
matter
in
simple
case
attention
is
drawn
to
the
strictly
algebraic
difficulties
encountered
in
this
