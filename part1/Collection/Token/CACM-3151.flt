an
optimal
real-time
algorithm
for
planar
convex
hulls
an
algorithm
is
described
for
the
construction
in
real-time
of
the
convex
hull
of
set
of
points
in
the
plane
using
an
appropriate
data
structure
the
algorithm
constructs
the
convex
hull
by
successive
updates
each
taking
time
log
thereby
achieving
total
