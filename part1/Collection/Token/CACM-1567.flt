the
representation
of
symmetric
polynomials
relations
are
given
between
certain
symmetric
polynomials
in
the
light
of
the
theory
of
the
symmetric
group
such
an
approach
unifies
earlier
work
and
lends
insight
to
previously
published
work
by
aaron
booker
generalization
of
graeffe
root-squaring
technique
for
the
determination
of
the
roots
of
polynomial
is
suggested
