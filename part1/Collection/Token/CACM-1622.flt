an
efficient
procedure
for
the
generation
of
closed
subsets
an
efficient
algorithm
is
described
for
generating
subsets
of
set
which
satisfy
constraints
of
the
form
if
is
member
of
the
subset
then
must
also
be
member
of
the
subset
the
algorithm
has
been
programmed
in
the
wisp
language
and
successfully
run
on
the
ibm
in
connection
with
routine
to
detect
feedback
in
multidimensional
iterative
networks
