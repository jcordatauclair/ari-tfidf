near-minimax
polynomial
approximations
and
partitioning
of
intervals
method
of
near-minimax
polynomial
approximation
is
described
as
by-product
this
method
provides
formula
for
an
estimate
of
the
maximum
error
associated
with
given
degree
of
approximation
using
this
formula
partitioning
algorithm
is
obtained
for
dividing
basic
interval
into
subintervals
for
which
approximations
of
equal
degree
give
equal
maximum
error
