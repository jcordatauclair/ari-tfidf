design
of
separable

compiler*
cobol
compiler
design
is
presented
which
is
compact
enough
to
permit
rapid
one-pass
compilation
of
large
subset
of
cobol
on
moderately
large
computer
versions
of
the
same
compiler
for
smaller
machines
require
only
two
working
tapes
plus
compiler
tape
the
methods
given
are
largely
applicable
to
the
construction
of
algol
compilers
