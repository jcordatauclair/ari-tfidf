reducing
truncation
errors
using
cascading
accumulators
when
accumulating
large
number
of
quantities
as
in
numerical
integration
the
sum
itself
may
become
much
larger
than
the
individual
addends
this
results
in
truncation
error
much
of
this
error
can
be
eliminated
using
cascading
accumulators
as
noted
in
recent
article
by
wolfe
simpler
and
slightly
more
flexible
algorithm
is
presented
which
deals
also
with
the
case
of
negative
addends
