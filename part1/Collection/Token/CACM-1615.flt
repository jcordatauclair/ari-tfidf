an
algorithm
for
generating
root
locus
diagrams
technique
for
using
digital
computer
to
draw
both
ordinary
and
time-lag
root
locus
diagrams
is
described
ordinary
diagrams
are
drawn
much
faster
and
more
accurately
than
ever
before
time-lag
diagrams
which
had
been
impossible
to
obtain
are
drawn
with
the
same
speed
and
accuracy
as
ordinary
diagrams
