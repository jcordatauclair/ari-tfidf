reducing

techniques
new
method
for
entering
and
retrieving
information
in
hash
table
is
described
the
method
is
intended
to
be
efficient
if
most
entries
are
looked
up
several
times
the
expected
number
of
probes
to
look
up
an
entry
predicted
theoretically
and
verified
by
monte
carlo
experiments
is
considerably
less
than
for
other
comparable
methods
if
the
table
is
nearly
full
an
example
of
possible
fortran
implementation
is
given
