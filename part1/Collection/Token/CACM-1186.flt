an
example
combinatorial
problems
requiring
the
selection
of
elements
from
set
of
elements
may
be
solved
by
recursion
process
analogous
to
that
for
computing
binomial
coefficients
several
specific
problems
are
analyzed
the
general
technique
is
exposed
and
an
algol
program
is
developed
for
one
of
the
problems
