guarded
commands
nondeterminacy
and
formal
derivation
of
programs
so-called
guarded
commands
are
introduced
as
building
block
for
alternative
and
repetitive
constructs
that
allow
nondeterministic
program
components
for
which
at
least
the
activity
evoked
but
possible
even
the
final
state
is
not
necessarily
uniquely
determined
by
the
initial
state
for
the
formal
derivation
of
programs
expressed
in
terms
of
these
constructs
calculus
will
be
shown
